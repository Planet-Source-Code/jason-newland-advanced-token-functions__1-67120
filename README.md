## Advanced Token Functions


</div>

### Description

From time to time when using VB one needs a Token identifier of some description to do simple string manipulation without the need to do big loops and InStr. There are 8 total token functions within the module AddTok, DelTok, PutTok, RepTok, InsTok, GetTok, IsTok and FindTok.

Hope this has proved useful for someone and I wrote it over 6 months ago as the sources on the net i found for GetTok just did not provide the functionality of string manipulation that I required. A good use for this module would be in an IRC client or such other chat program (or anything for that matter) for parsing and splitting the incoming socket data.

:) have fun!
